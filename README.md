# Advancement_in_Fingerprint_Verification_using_python

In this project, I have attached the working source code in Python with a screen recoring of the project with the dataset, which I have downloaded through Kaggle.

The dataset is named the Sokoto Coventry Fingerprint dataset or in short, SOCOFing.

Here is the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruizgara/socofing

Fingerprint scanners are security systems for biometrics. Everyone has patterns of friction ridges on their fingers, and it is this pattern that is called fingerprint. Fingerprints are uniquely detailed and durable over an individualâ€™s lifetime, and difficult to alter. Because there are countless combinations, Fingerprints have become an ideal means of identification. They are used in police stations, security industries, smartphones, and other mobile devices. So, in this project, i have two directories inside the main directory and Those contain images of fingerprints; now the real directory contains images of actual fingerprint, so i can see here always a number, then a character. representing a gender, so the number is the ID of the main character. and then the name of the fingerprint. For example, the left index finger and all The files are real fingerprints without any modifications, and then i also have the altered directory, and inside the altered directory, we have three sub-directories. directories, easy, medium, and hard, then we have data sets, then by using an external library opencv, in which we take the altered image, and then we will Find the real fingerprints.

First, you have to install two major libraries for this code to work. These are OpenCV, also known as cv2, and os.
Also dont forget about python IDE XD

Now you have everything for this code to work. For it to work on your system, just change the file directory.
